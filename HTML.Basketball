                       <h1>Background</h1>
                      <p>We used average in-games statistics for the 2021-22 NBA regular season up until 3/26 to simulate the 2022 NBA Playoffs
                        Seeding was based on current NBA standings (3/26)
                        https://www.basketball-reference.com/
                        Data Wrangling was performed in R and Python
                        Modeling was performed in R 
                        Regular season matchup statistics were used to predict the winner of each playoff series with our model
                        Simulation was performed in Python
                        Winners of a series were determined by the team who had the highest average predicted points per game vs. their specific opponent

                    <p>A multiple linear regression model was built using Points as a response variable and other significant in-game statistics as predictor variables 
                        Akaike Information Criterion was used in the model
